# Typescript workshop

## Type examples

`workshop.tsx` contains all of the type examples that you can refer to when doing the task

## Transform Example app

- Rename files one by one `.js` ->`.ts` and `.jsx` -> `.tsx`.
- Add all necessary types so there are no values without a type (infered or declared).
- You can run the app locally: `pnpm install` (first time), then `pnpm run dev`
